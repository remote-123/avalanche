                    <h4 class="center" style="color: #3868c0;"><strong>Binding Arbitration.</strong></h4>
                    <p>
                        Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or proceedings (collectively,  “Disputes”) in which either Party seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use  of intellectual property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade  
                        secrets or patents, you and Company (i) waive your and Company’s respective rights to have any and  all Disputes arising from or related to these Terms resolved in a court, and (ii) waive your and  Company’s respective rights to a jury trial. Instead, you and Company will arbitrate Disputes through  binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing  the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute  decided by a judge or jury in court). 
                        No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions.  
                        Any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms is personal to you and Company and will be  resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action  or any other type of representative proceeding. There will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of  individuals. Further, a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action,  whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals. 
                        Process.  
                        Arbitration will be conducted confidentially. Any Dispute shall be referred to and finally resolved by  arbitration administered by the London Court of International Arbitration (“LCIA”) in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the England and Wales, for the time being in force, which rules are deemed to  be incorporated by reference in this clause. The seat of the arbitration shall be England. The Tribunal  shall consist of one (1) or three (3) arbitrator(s). The language of the arbitration shall be English. The  English judicial system will have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an  arbitration award. All costs of Arbitration will be born and maintained by you.  
                        Authority of Arbitrator(s) 
                        As limited by these Terms and the applicable LCIA rules, the arbitrator(s) will have (i) the exclusive  authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute,  including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and (ii) the authority to grant any  remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have  the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these  Terms. The arbitrator(s) may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than  one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any  proceeding involving more than one individual.
                        Severability of Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Provisions. 
                        If any term, clause or provision of this Section is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be so held to the  minimum extent required by law, and all other terms, clauses and provisions of this Section will remain valid and enforceable. Further, the waivers set forth in this Section are severable from the other  provisions of these Terms and will remain valid and enforceable, except as prohibited by applicable  law. 
                        Governing Law and Venue 
                        These Terms will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the  United Kingdom (Specifically the British Virgin Islands) without regard to conflict of law rules or  principles that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any Dispute between  the Parties arising out or relating to these Terms or its subject matter or formation (including non contractual Disputes of claims) that is not subject to arbitration will be resolved in the courts of  England applying the laws of the British Virgin Islands. 
                        Severability  
                        If any term, clause or provision of these Terms is held unlawful, void or unenforceable, then that term,  clause or provision will be severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability  of any remaining part of that term, clause or provision, or any other term, clause or provision of these  Terms. 
                        Miscellaneous 
                        These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us relating to your purchase of Tokens  from us. We may make changes to these Terms from time to time as reasonably required to comply  with applicable law or regulation. If we make changes, we will post the amended Terms at our website  and update the “Last Updated” date above. The amended Terms will be effective immediately. We may assign our rights and obligations under these Terms. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or  provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. We will not be liable  for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under these Terms where the delay or failure results  from any cause beyond our reasonable control. 
                        Purchasing Tokens from us does not create any form of partnership, joint venture or any other similar  relationship between you and us. Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely  for the benefit of you and us and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any  other person or entity. You agree and acknowledge that all agreements, notices, disclosures, and other  communications that we provide to you, including these Terms, will be provided in electronic form. 
                        Waiver  
                        The parties hereto agree to a uniform waiver of any and all claims in equity, contract, or criminal,  against one another weather known, unknown, or anticipated.  
                        Assignment  
                        The user may not assign this agreement under any circumstances. Social Fabric may assign it to a third  party or other corporation by providing written notice to the other party.

                    <p>
                        Any portion of these Terms that reasonably should survive the termination of your License or any other agreement is hereby agreed to do so. If any provision of these terms is deemed illegal, invalid or  otherwise invalid for any reason, then that provision will be severed and the rest of these Terms will  remain intact and enforceable. 
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="center" style="color: #3868c0;"><strong>Integration</strong></h4>
                    <p>
                        Our failure to exercise or enforce any rights or provisions of these Terms does not constitute a waiver  of those rights or provisions. These Terms represent the entire and complete agreement between the  User and Social Fabric, including any future modification of these Terms, superseding any prior  agreements or communications between you and us. Any ambiguities in these Terms shall be construed in the light most favourable to Social Fabric. 
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="center" style="color: #3868c0;"><strong>Act of God </strong></h4>
                    <p>
                        Social Fabric' performance under these Terms shall be excused if the failure of such performance is  caused by forces beyond its reasonable control. This includes (but is not limited to) acts of God, acts of  any government, war or civil unrest, severe weather, fire, natural disasters, political embargoes,  terrorism, power or equipment failure, industrial or labor disputes or controversies, acts of any third  party, or blockchain failures. Thus Social Fabric is not liable for failure to perform solely caused by  unavoidable force majeure casualty, acts by common carriers, emergency conditions, or any similar  unforeseen event that renders performance commercially implausible.  
                        If such an event of force majeure occurs, the party injured by the other’s inability to perform may elect  to suspend the Agreement, in whole or part, for the duration of the force majeure circumstances. The  party experiencing the force majeure circumstances shall cooperate with and assist the injured party in 
                        all reasonable ways to minimize the impact of force majeure on the injured

                    <h4 class="center" style="color: #3868c0;"><strong>Token Supply </strong></h4>
                    <p>
                        The company total Token supply is 89,683,486. Undistributed Tokens will be retained in inventory to  be utilized as a Development Fund.  
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="align-center" style="color: #3868c0;"><strong>Exhibit C</strong></h2>
                    <h4 class="center" style="color: #3868c0;"><strong>Certain Risk Factors Relating to Purchase, Sale and Use of Tokens </strong></h4>
                    <p>
                        Important Note: As noted elsewhere in these Terms, the Tokens are not being structured or sold as  securities or any other form of investment product. Accordingly, none of the information presented in  this Exhibit C is intended to form the basis for any investment decision, and no specific  recommendations are intended. Company expressly disclaims any and all responsibility for any direct  or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever arising directly or indirectly from: (i) reliance  on any information contained in this Exhibit C, (ii) any error, omission or inaccuracy in any such  information or (iii) any action resulting from such information. 
                        By purchasing, holding and using Tokens, you expressly acknowledge and assume the following risks: 

                    </p>
                    <h4 class="center" style="color: #3868c0;"><strong>Risk of Losing Access to Tokens Due to Loss of Private Key(s)</strong></h4>
                    <p>
                        A private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to control and dispose of Tokens stored in  your digital wallet. Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s) associated with your digital wallet  storing Tokens will result in loss of such Tokens. Moreover, any third party that gains access to such  private key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet service you use, may  be able to misappropriate your Tokens. 
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="center" style="color: #3868c0;"><strong>Risks Associated with the Ethereum Protocol </strong></h4>
                    <p>
                        Because Tokens and the Network are based on the Ethereum protocol, any malfunction, breakdown or  abandonment of the Ethereum protocol may have a material adverse effect on the Network or Tokens.  Moreover, advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum  computing, could present risks to the Tokens and the Network by rendering ineffective the  cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins the Ethereum protocol. 
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="center" style="color: #3868c0;"><strong>Risk of Mining Attacks</strong></h4>
                    <p>
                        As with other decentralized cryptographic Tokens based on the Ethereum protocol, the Tokens are  susceptible to attacks by miners in the course of validating Tokentransactions on the Ethereum  blockchain, including, but not limited, to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, and  selfish-mining attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Network and the Tokens, including,  but not limited to, accurate execution and recording of transactions involving Tokens. 
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="center" style="color: #3868c0;"><strong>Risk of Hacking and Security Weaknesses </strong></h4>
                    <p>
                        Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the Network or the  Tokens in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, treasury vulnerability, malware attacks,  denial of service
                        attacks, consensus-based attacks, man in the middle, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing.  Furthermore, because the Network is based on open-source software, there is a risk that a third party or  a member of the Company team may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the  core infrastructure of the Network, which could negatively affect the Network and the Tokens.  
                        Hackers or other groups or organizations may attempt to steal the ETH or BTC revenue from the initial  sale, thus potentially impacting the ability of Social Fabric to develop the Social Fabric Platform and  operate the Network. To account for this risk, Social Fabric has and will continue to implement  comprehensive security precautions to safeguard the proceeds obtained from the sale of Tokens. Multi factor security measures will be taken to protect ETH, BTC and all currencies and proceeds including  physical elements, algorithms, multisignature keys, anti-spear-phishing procedures, splitting of funds,  hot/cold wallet partitioning and diversification. Moreover, regular security audits of hot and cold  wallets will be conducted by internal and external teams. As acknowledged, there is always a risk that  the Social Fabric Team, or other third parties not directly affiliated with the Parties, may intentionally  or unintentionally introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural elements of the Social  Fabric Platform causing the system to lose Tokens stored in one or more Purchaser accounts or other  accounts or lose sums of other valued Tokens issued on the Social Fabric Platform. Social Fabric has  taken steps to build, maintain, and secure the infrastructure of the Social Fabric Platform, and will  continue to do so after the initial sale. For example, Social Fabric intends to hire external consultants  on a periodic basis to assess and audit the security of the Social Fabric Platform and will work with  cryptography and security experts to develop and employ best practices to audit the Platform. As  acknowledged by both parties, advances in code cracking, or technical advances such as the  development of quantum computers, could present risks to cryptocurrencies and the Social Fabric  Platform, which could result in the theft or loss of Tokens or other valuable assets. To the extent  possible, Tokens intends to update the protocol underlying the Social Fabric Platform to account for  any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures, but it cannot predict the  future of cryptography or the success of any future security updates. As with other cryptocurrencies,  the blockchain used for the Social Fabric Platform is susceptible to mining attacks, among others. Any  successful attacks present a risk to the Ethereum Platform generally, and the Social Fabric network  specifically, effecting expected proper execution and sequencing of Tokens transactions, and expected  proper execution and sequencing of contract computations, as well as other potential losses identified  here as risk factors, in addition to those unidentified or unexpected. The purchase of Tokens carries  with these significant risks. Prior to purchasing Tokens, the Purchaser should carefully consider the  risks herein identified, and, to the extent necessary, consult experts of your choosing ( cryptographic  and cyber security specialists, lawyers, accountants, and/or other professionals) prior to determining  whether to purchase Tokens.  

                    </p>
                    <h4 class="center" style="color: #3868c0;"><strong>Risks Associated with Markets for Tokens </strong></h4>
                    <p>
                        The Tokens are intended to be used solely within the Network, and Company will not support or  otherwise facilitate any secondary trading or external valuation of Tokens. This restricts the  contemplated avenues for using Tokens to the provision or receipt of Services, and could therefore  create illiquidity risk with respect to the Tokens you hold. Even if secondary trading of Tokens is  facilitated by third party exchanges, such exchanges may be relatively new and subject to little or no  regulatory oversight, making them more susceptible to fraud or manipulation. 
                        Furthermore, to the extent that third parties do ascribe an external exchange value to Tokens (e.g., as  denominated in a digital or fiat currency), such value may be extremely volatile and diminish to zero. 

                    </p>
                    <h4 class="center" style="color: #3868c0;"><strong>Risk of Uninsured Losses</strong></h4>
                    <p>
                        Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions, Tokens are uninsured unless you  specifically obtain private insurance to insure them. Thus, in the event of loss or loss of utility value,  there is no public insurer, such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or private insurance  arranged by us, to offer recourse to you.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="center" style="color: #3868c0;"><strong>Risks Associated with Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions </strong></h4>
                    <p>
                        The regulatory status of the Tokens and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many  jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation  with respect to such technology and its applications, including the Network and the Tokens. It is  likewise difficult to predict how or whether legislatures or regulatory agencies may implement changes  to law and regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including the  Network and the Tokens. Regulatory actions could negatively impact the Network and the Tokens in  various ways, including, for purposes of illustration only, through a determination that Tokens are a  regulated financial instrument that require registration or licensing. Company may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to  operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction. 
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="center" style="color: #3868c0;"><strong>Risks Arising from Taxation </strong></h4>
                    <p>
                        The tax characterization of Tokens is uncertain. You must seek your own tax advice in connection with purchasing Tokens, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you, including withholding taxes,  income taxes and tax reporting requirements. 

                    </p>
                    <h4 class="center" style="color: #3868c0;"><strong>Risk of Alternative Networks </strong></h4>
                    <p>
                        It is possible that alternative networks could be established that utilize the same open source code and  protocol underlying the Network and attempt to facilitate services that are materially similar to the  Services. The Network may compete with these alternative networks, which could negatively impact  the Network and Tokens. 
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="center" style="color: #3868c0;"><strong>Risk of Insufficient Interest in the Network or Distributed Applications </strong></h4>
                    <p>
                        It is possible that the Network will not be used by a large number of individuals, companies and other  entities or that there will be limited public interest in the creation and development of distributed  ecosystems (such as the Network) more generally. Such a lack of use or interest could negatively  impact the development of the Network and therefore the potential utility of Tokens. 
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="center" style="color: #3868c0;"><strong>Risks Associated with the Development and Maintenance of the Network </strong></h4>
                    <p>
                        The Network is still under development and may undergo significant changes over time. Although we  intend for the Tokens and Network to follow the specifications set forth in our Terms and Conditions,  and throughout or site, and intend to take commercially reasonable steps toward those ends, we may  have to make changes to the specifications of the Tokens or Network for any number of legitimate  reasons. 
                        This could create the risk that the Tokens or Network, as further developed and maintained, may not  meet your expectations at the time of purchase. Furthermore, despite our good faith efforts to develop 
                        and maintain the Network, it is still possible that the Network will experience malfunctions or  otherwise fail to be adequately developed or maintained, which may negatively impact the Network  and Tokens. 

                    </p>
                    <h4 class="center" style="color: #3868c0;"><strong>Risk of an Unfavorable Fluctuation of Ether and Other Currency Value</strong></h4>
                    <p>
                        The Company team intends to use the proceeds from selling Tokens to fund the maintenance and  development of the Network, as described further in the Terms of Sale. The proceeds of the Token sale  will be denominated in Ether or Bitcoin, and converted into other cryptographic and fiat currencies. In  addition, some pre-sales of the Tokens may also be denominated in fiat currencies. If the value of Ether or other currencies fluctuates unfavorably during or after the Sale Period, the Company team may not  be able to fund development, or may not be able to develop or maintain the Network in the manner that it intended. 
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="center" style="color: #3868c0;"><strong>Risk of Dissolution of the Company or Network </strong></h4>
                    <p>
                        It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, an unfavorable  fluctuation in the value of Ether (or other cryptographic and fiat currencies), decrease in the Tokens’  utility, the failure of commercial relationships, or intellectual property ownership challenges, the  Network may no longer be viable to operate and the Company may dissolve. 
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="center" style="color: #3868c0;"><strong>Risks Arising from Lack of Governance Rights </strong></h4>
                    <p>
                        Because Tokens confer no governance rights of any kind with respect to the Network or Company or  its corporate affiliates, all decisions involving the Network or Company will be made by Company at  its sole discretion, including, but not limited to, decisions to discontinue the Network, to create and sell  more Tokens for use in the Network, or to sell or liquidate the Company. These decisions could  adversely affect the Network and the Tokens you hold. 
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="center" style="color: #3868c0;"><strong>Risks Involving Cloud Storage </strong></h4>
                    <p>
                        As the Company provides services to individual and institutional clients, including users and  applications which involves data storage to some extent, the Services are susceptible to a number of  risks related to the storage of data in the cloud. While the Company does not have access to the  contents of the data stored through the Services, the Services may involve the storage of large amounts  of sensitive and/or proprietary information, which may be compromised in the event of a cyber- attack  or other malicious activity. Similarly, the Services may be interrupted and files may become  temporarily unavailable in the event of such an attack or malicious activity. Because users can use a  variety of hardware and software that may interface with the Network, there is the risk that the Services may become unavailable or interrupted based on a failure of interoperability or an inability to integrate  these third-party systems and devices that the Company does not control with the Company’s Services.  The risk that the Services may face increasing interruptions and the Network may face additional  security vulnerabilities could adversely affect the Network and therefore the future utility of any  Tokens that you hold. 
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="center" style="color: #3868c0;"><strong>Unanticipated Risks </strong></h4>
                    <p>
                        Cryptographic Tokens such as Social Fabric are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks  included in this Exhibit C, there are other risks associated with your purchase, holding and use of 
Tokens, including those that the Company cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materialize as  unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed in this Exhibit C.
